The purpose of this module is to support data sharing of the object information that related to the construction project. This module describes the concepts (or ‘classes’) of basic objects in the construction process and their properties and hierarchy. The core concept  is the ‘Domain Object’, which refers the top abstract concept of all the objects (physical entities, information entities, resources, activities and groups). One domain object has its own identifier (e.g. URI), and it may has a classification that classified by some classification scheme (e.g.  OmniClass). It also may have its level assignment to illustrate it belongs to which level of detail. Meanwhile, it may have its own breakdown structure, known as decomposition type. The construction objects module can be used for the use cases that collecting the basic information of the elements."
